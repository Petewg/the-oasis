<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Support and corporate issues</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Is it true that Nantucket, the original Clipper</A>
vendor, was bought by Computer Associates?</H2>

<P>Such an agreement was announced on the 6th of May 1992.  Computer
Associates acquired Nantucket, the original publisher of Clipper.
The Clipper product is now known formally as "CA-Clipper."
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Where can I get technical support for CA-Clipper?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
The phone number (in the United States) for CA-Clipper technical
support is +1 516 342 4612.  (If you do not reach a qualified
technician right away my experience is that you will receive a
phone call back within about two hours.)  You must already have
a site number assigned by Computer Associates to use telephone
support.  Fortunately, one is provided when you send in your
CA-Clipper registration card.  If you never received your site
ID, or forgot it, support will usually look it up for you if you
ask nicely.
<P>Computer Associates has a staff member assigned to monitor the CLIPPER
forum on Compuserve and answer questions for users.  Computer Associates
staff members also read comp.lang.clipper with some
regularity, although their presence is not a formal CA support function.
<P>Your local PC user group is likely to have a database programming
section or CA-Clipper special-interest group.  You can find a list
of recognized CA-Clipper user groups at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cai.com/CAproducts/clipper/clipvoug.txt">ftp://ftp.cai.com/CAproducts/clipper/clipvoug.txt</A> and
a more current but less complete one at
<A HREF="http://www.causergroups.com">http://www.causergroups.com</A>.  (The latter is also just
horrible in accessibility terms.  You really cannot make much sense
of it without a graphical browser.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Where can I get technical support for CA-Visual Objects?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
The phone number (in the United States) for CA-Visual Objects technical
support is +1 516 342 4620.
<P>CA-Visual Objects 1.0 is supported on the Compuserve forum VOFORUM.
<P>CA-Visual Objects 2.0 is supported on the Compuserve forum CAVO20.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Where can I buy CA-Clipper, CA-Visual Objects,</A>
and related third-party software products?</H2>

<P> 
Any reasonably large software mail-order house
in North America should carry CA-Clipper 5.3a for a
price in the range of 400-600 dollars U.S.  There are discounts for
educational institutions and for live or competitive upgrades. CA-Clipper
usually costs more outside of the US and Canada.
<P>CA-Visual Objects 1.0c-2 can be ordered from the same places.
<P>CA-Visual Objects 2.0 Standard is available for just under 100 US dollars from
most resellers.  CA-Visual Objects 2.0 Professional will cost just under
200 US dollars.
<P>Publishers and resellers who specialize in CA-Clipper and
CA-Visual Objects include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.zaccatalog.com">Zac Catalog</A>, the original
"Clipper-Only Tools" shop;</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.grafxsoft.com">GrafX</A>, a dedicated source
for CA-Visual Objects enthusiasts; and</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.siriuspress.com">Sirius Press</A>, which is also
actively developing and marketing add-ons for the
<A HREF="http://www.cai.com/products/jasmine.htm">Jasmine</A>
object-oriented database that CA developed along with Fujitsu.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 Where can I get a copy of Clipper Summer '87? Any other versions prior to 5.3?</A>
</H2>

<P>Generally, nowhere that you can count on.  The best advice is
to watch forums, bulletin boards, and the newsgroups for offers to
transfer a license on a new or used copy.  Neither CA
nor its major resellers is selling Summer '87 anymore.
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.wdn.com/ems/index.html">EMS Professional Software</A>
buys and sells old compilers of all kinds.  You're looking at perhaps
USD 179.00 plus shipping from Maryland, USA.  They appear to have a few
copies of Summer '87 and 5.2 in stock at most times.  Right now (March 1998)
you can even get Autumn '86!
<P>
<P>For the record, CA does NOT allow free use of Clipper Summer '87
on the same CPU for which CA-Clipper is already licensed.  You
really do need to scrounge a copy of Summer '87 to be legit.
