<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Changes to the FAQ in 2.31</A>
</H2>

<P>From this point on a number of 
<A HREF="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</A> regulars have got together to look after the FAQ
and keep it up to date (not that Mark hasn't been doing a sterling job in
that department, this is simply an exercise in spreading the workload).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Major Changes to the FAQ in 2.30</A>
</H2>

<P>I updated version numbers, verified and read contents of all WWW URLs,
and added a few new questions in the "Everything Else" category.
I contacted each person who contributed an answer for permission to
use the answer and to include his/her name and/or email address.
<P>The WWW version actually validates as HTML4 Transitional since I made
some tweaks in the linuxdoc-sgml output.  There are even spiffy little
navigation buttons at the bottom of each page.  (Kewl!)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Major Changes to the FAQ in 2.20</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>I am now upping the rev to 2.20 and producing
the document with the excellent <EM>linuxdoc-sgml</EM> package on
my Linux system.  This makes it easy for me to keep parallel versions
of the document in TeX, ASCII, and HTML.
<P>Version 2.20 still isn't very clean: a lot of questions are
miscategorized, and I don't have answers for some questions, and the
whole thing still needs much more VO stuff.  But it is more up
to date than before.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>I've added a little (very little) information about CA-Visual Objects.
</LI>
<LI>I've completely dropped programming techniques for Clipper Summer '87.
If you are still using this version of the compiler you need more than
this FAQ file. :-(
</LI>
<LI> I've noted many files that can be obtained from Library
such-and-such.  These are all (unless otherwise noted) from the CLIPPER
forum on Compuserve.  At the end of this document I tell you how to get
access to Compuserve.
</LI>
<LI>I was using the Usenet standard "Suggested Minimal Digest Format"
so this can be archived on rtfm.mit.edu, but it turned out later
to be much easier to maintain the document using Linuxdoc-SGML.
Maybe there is a good way to convert L-SGML to SMDF.
</LI>
<LI>A lot of material is new here.  I am likely to have missed a few details.

<LI>Update reseller and third-party list.</LI>
