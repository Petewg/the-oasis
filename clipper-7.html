<P> 
The Nanforum Toolkit originated in November 1990 when a number
of Clipper developers on Compuserve felt the same way and started
to develop their own public domain, user supported library.  You
can get started by downloading NFREAD.ME (about 1K) from
Library 16.
<P> 
NETTO is a library that contains many useful Netware API
functions.  It was developed in the same spirit (and by some of
the same people) as NANFOR.  You can get started by downloading
NEDESC.TXT from Library 16.

The 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.iag.net/pub/clipper/library/gt_src.zip">GT Library</A>
was likewise developed by the regulars on the GT Power network's Clipper echo.
<P>Vern Six of
<A HREF="http://www.person.com/our-software.html">CenTex Computer Consulting</A>
also offers his libraries as public domain and freeware.
