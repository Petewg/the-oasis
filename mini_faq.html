      <H3><B>Q: What is Clipper?</B></H3>

    <P> A: In this newsgroup, "Clipper" refers to a  database oriented
      programming language for PC platforms.  The primary  compiler is
      published by Computer Associates as CA-Clipper.  The latest  release is
      5.3, which includes a Windows development environment.

    <P> Although originally thought of as a dBASE III compiler, Clipper has
      developed  into a language of its own. It now incorporates some of the
      basics of  object oriented programming through built-in classes,
      replaceable  database drivers, and code blocks.

    <P>There is no Windows  version, but there are third party products
      that let you port Clipper  applications  to Windows. There is also a
      Clipper compatible compiler  for most  flavors of UNIX, called
      FlagShip. There is also the new Alaska Xbase++, which is a superset of
      Clipper 5.2, and is a 32 bit compiler for Windows.

    <P> <B>Note</B>: There is an unrelated encryption chip also known as
      Clipper. Please direct messages pertaining to the Clipper chip
      elsewhere (try the Usenet newsgroups alt.privacy or
      alt.privacy.clipper).

      <HR>

      <H3><B>Q: What is CA-Visual Objects (AKA: VO, CAVO)?</B></H3>

    <P> A: From Mark  Schumann's CA-Clipper FAQ: "CA-Visual Objects is an
      object-oriented  Windows-based applications development environment
      with  repository-based source management and an incremental compiler.
      It  includes interfaces to many major database engines via the ODBC ...
      standard."  Note that VO is not a Windows version of Clipper.

      <HR>
      <H3><B>Q: Is there a Usenet newsgroup on CA-Clipper?</B></H3>

    <P> A: Yes, two of  them: <A href="comp.lang.clipper">
      comp.lang.clipper</A> (c.l.c.) and <A href="news://alt.comp.databases.xbase.clipper">
      alt.comp.databases.xbase.clipper</A> (a.c.d.x.c).

    <P>The group <A href="news://comp.databases.xbase.misc">
      comp.databases.xbase.misc</A> is mostly dBASE, but there are occasional
      Clipper posts.

    <P> The c.l.c group was created early in 1995 and supersedes a.c.d.x.c.
      Please use comp.lang.clipper for Clipper related messages. If you are
      having trouble getting c.l.c, contact your news server administrator.

    <P> In the Spring of 1997, comp.lang.clipper.visual-objects was
      created. Please post VO related messages there to keep c.l.c on Clipper
      as much as possible.

    <P> It is possible that some people will never be able to get the c.l.c
      groups. Since alt groups never die, and Clipperheads are  a sympathetic
      lot, you can rest assured that a.c.d.x.c will remain active for quite
      some time. You can also be assured that you will receive comments from
      well-intentioned souls urging you to switch to the c.l.c groups. Ignore
      them. If they persist, refer them to this mini-FAQ. With a smile, of
      course.  :)

      <HR>

      <H3><B>Q: Is there a Usenet newsgroup on CA-Visual Objects?</B></H3>

    <P> A: Yes, <A href="news://comp.lang.clipper.visual-objects">
      comp.lang.clipper.visual-objects</A> Please direct VO specific
      questions to that group.

      <HR>

      <H3><B>Q: Is there a Usenet newsgroup on Alaska's Xbase++?</B></H3>

    <P> A: Yes, <A href="news://alt.comp.databases.xbase++">
      alt.comp.databases.xbase++</A>. Please direct Alaska Xbase++ specific
      questions to that group.

      <HR>

      <H3><B>Q: Where can I get the real Clipper FAQ?</B></H3>

    <P> A: The real FAQ is now maintained by Dave Pearson, with help by
      other Clipper programmers. Try these sources:<BR>

      <B>Remember:</B> Most users consider alt.comp.databases.xbase.clipper
      "obsolete." Please direct all posts to comp.lang.clipper and
      comp.lang.clipper.visual-objects if possible. Thank you.
