client's machines for support purposes; we don't want to force themto buy dBase just to clean up a file here and there.Is it legal to do so?</H2>

development machines onto a LAN.  This way we can buy onecopy of CA-Clipper for the three programmers, right?</H2>

<P>
<P>Wrong.  The CA license allows the product to be used on a network,
but there still must be one license for each developer.  Specifically,
"floating" licenses are not allowed.
