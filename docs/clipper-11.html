<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 Are there any other FAQs for Clipperheads?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes.  In particular, you will want to check out Peter Tilstead's
thorough and outstanding programmer's FAQ for CA-Visual Objects.  It's file
<CODE>vo1_faq.zip</CODE> in Library 2 of VOFORUM on Compuserve.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 What bulletin boards are available for CA-Clipper developers?</A>
</H2>

<P>A complete list may be found in CLPBBS.ZIP in Library 0.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.3">11.3 What about Compuserve?</A>
</H2>

<P>Compuserve can still be said to be the central communcation spot
of the CA-Clipper and CA-Visual Objects
developers' community.  28800bps access costs about
USD 4.80 per hour in the United States and Canada, and much
more elsewhere.  When you join Compuserve, type GO CLIPPER to
join the Forum, where Computer Associates staff people and (I mean this
very literally) hundreds of other CA-Clipper developers visit every
day to check messages, ask questions, and offer help.  The CLIPPER
forum also carries what must be the largest collection of public
domain, shareware, and freeware of interest to CA-Clipper
developers.
<P>For more information on joining Compuserve, please call (in the
United States) 1-800-848-8980.  This is a voice-only number.
I will be happy to provide phone numbers or other pointers for
non-U.S. users.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4 How do I email a Compuserve user from Internet?</A>
</H2>

<P>Simply replace the comma in the user's Compuserve address with a
period, and then append "@compuserve.com" to the result.  (Therefore
you can reach my Compuserve mailbox 73750,3527 as
&lt;73750.3527@compuserve.com> from Internet.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 Is there a mailing list for CA-Clipper users on the</A>
Internet or Bitnet?  Fidonet?  Others?</H2>

<P> 
Yes.  You can subscribe by sending the message "SUBSCRIBE CLIPPER
Your-Name-Here" to &lt;LISTSERV@BRUFPB> on Bitnet.  Send administrative
requests to &lt;LISTSERV@BRUFPB> on Bitnet.  When you join the mailing
list you will be emailed instructions on how to post contributions
to the list.
<P> 
On Fidonet, check the CLIPPER echo.
<P> 
There is also an active CA-Clipper echo on the cozier but
lesser-known GT Power network.
<P> 
<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6 Are there Usenet newsgroups?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
<CODE>comp.lang.clipper</CODE> is the major one for Clipper.  If you count
alt groups, there's also <CODE>alt.comp.databases.xbase.clipper</CODE>,
but that group has been abandoned by most users.
<P><CODE>comp.lang.clipper.visual-objects</CODE> is for VO.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.7">11.7 What is Client Care?</A>
</H2>

<P>Client Care is Computer Associates' general customer service bureau.
In the United States this is +1 800 531 5236.  On Compuserve it is
73303,1046.  I do not have the number for voice calls from outside
the United States, but you can call the main switchboard at
+1 516 342 6000 and ask for Client Care.

is maintained by Chee Chong Hwa, a businessman and programmer in
Malaysia.  Chong ("Chee" is his surname) has collected dozens of useful
text files for Clipper developers, including essays by Clipper
luminaries such as Tom Leylan and Roger Donnay.  I'd seen much of
this stuff already but never all in the same place.  It's a good
place to browse if you want to learn more about Clipper, even
if you're already an expert.
