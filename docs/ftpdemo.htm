  b) display a message at program termination indicating that the<BR>

<P> The CALC and all included functions are written entirely in Clipper<BR>

<P> A Clipper Graphic Print System ...<BR>

<P> * Who should read further on ?<BR>

<P> Developer of Clipper 5.x applications, who would like to include<BR>

  PRINTER INDEPENDENT FONTS, use there OWN FONT STYLES OR SIZES, SYMBOL<BR>

  LIBRARIES and more.<BR>

<P> E.g. put 72pt text on labels for pricing or use a gothic like print<BR>
  style on printers, which usually have only courier style. Make sure,<BR>

  your application also will print the same way on a matrix printer, not<BR>

  only on some kind of postscript or laserjet printers. Feel free to<BR>

  design, scale, modify, create, effect any of your favorite fonts, pass<BR>

  them to CB_GPR1x and use them together with or instead of plain text<BR>
  in your CLIPPER application reports, no need for font cartridges for<BR>

  lasers, no need for laser-printer at all, no Postscript required at<BR>

  all, nearly same printout style on matrix printers. Use multiple<BR>

  graphic fonts in your output to enhance the information. Use only a<BR>
  few symbols as a kind of 'font' to make your printout look like made<BR>

  with some graphical application.<BR>

<P> Evaluation version allows limited usage.<BR>

<P> Note from Phil:<BR>
  ===============<BR>
  Unfortunately, since this library was created, Grumpfish has gone out<BR>

  of business and is no longer selling or supporting the Grumpfish<BR>

  Library.<BR>

<P> Grumpfish Library Version 4 Demo<BR>
  ================================<BR>

<P> If your time is valuable to you, start saving it with Grumpfish<BR>

  Library. Grumpfish Library does the work while you get the praise!<BR>

<P> Grumpfish Library enables you to create CA-Clipper programs that will<BR>
  dazzle your clients and increase your profitability, while slashing<BR>

  your development and maintenance time. Unlike some products, you will<BR>

  not have to spend hours learning Grumpfish Library... the<BR>
  documentation and syntax are as comfortable as an old pair of jeans.<BR>

  Novice CA-Clipper developers can integrate Grumpfish modules into<BR>
  their programs within minutes of breaking the shrink-wrap. Advanced<BR>

  CA-Clipper developers will appreciate Grumpfish Library's power and<BR>

  flexibility (particularly the CA-Clipper 5.2 version).<BR>

<P> Grumpfish Library is written 99.99 percent in CA-Clipper. (Assembler<BR>
  is used only for transparent shadowing). Two versions of the source<BR>

  code are provided: one fully optimized for CA-Clipper 5.2 and another<BR>

  for CA-Clipper 5.01 (Summer '87 source code is also available free of<BR>

  charge).<BR>

<P> We give you the source code for these important reasons: (a) it<BR>

  liberates you to modify functions as needed to suit your specific<BR>

  needs; (b) it educates and inspires you to create more efficient and<BR>

  powerful code; and (c) it frees you from reliance on the developer<BR>

  (unlike many products which are completely proprietary).<BR>

<P> Grumpfish Library is fully optimized to take advantage of CA-Clipper<BR>
  5.2. It uses LOCAL and STATIC variables exclusively, and takes full<BR>

  advantage of CA-Clipper's TBrowse, TBColumn, Get, and Error object<BR>

  classes, nested and resizeable arrays, codeblocks and the<BR>
  preprocessor. If you are still in the process of converting from<BR>
  Summer '87 to CA-Clipper 5.x, having both versions of the Grumpfish<BR>

  source code gives you an invaluable head start.<BR>

<P> Grumpfish Library includes two years free unlimited on-line support,<BR>
  250+ pages of printed documentation, and a comprehensive Norton Guides<BR>

  reference database. Grumpfish Library also includes the traditional<BR>

  Grumpfish unlimited royalty-free integration license. Start saving<BR>
  time now with Grumpfish Library!<BR>

<P> Unlike other "demo" disks you might have received, this Multi-Edit<BR>

  demo is  truly  a FULLY FUNCTIONAL copy of the editor!  ANY SIZE FILE<BR>

  may be loaded, edited and saved.<BR>

<P> The differences between the demo and the full product are:<BR>

<P> 1. The introductory screens, which may not be bypassed.<BR>

<P> 2.  The on-line help and user's guide is more limited, and there is no<BR>
  macro language reference manual.<BR>

<P> 3.  The following advanced features are not included:  Network<BR>

  Support, Macro Debugger, Print formatter, Spell checker and<BR>

  Communications Module.<BR>

<P> 4.  Configuration changes last only for the current session and may<BR>
  not be saved.<BR>

<P> 5.  Technical support and maintenance updates are not included<BR>

<P> 6.  The DEMO takes much longer to load, and uses more memory than the<BR>
  regular Multi-Edit.<BR>

<P> 7.  The macro compiler and macro source is not included.<BR>

<P> EVOLVE DEMO<BR>

<P> The Demo now contains a fully functional demo of the add-on product<BR>
  EVOLVE.  This is a super-charged programming environment for Xbase<BR>

  languages Clipper, Dbase, Dbase for Windows, FoxPro and Arago.  You'll<BR>

  notice upon startup of Multi-Edit that you are prompted for one of 4<BR>

  function keys. Choose the one for Evolve to enable the Evolve Demo!<BR>

<P> RICH GRAPHIX LIBRARY for CA-Clipper.<BR>

<P> This Library will run Clipper in full graphic mode. It contains over<BR>
  180 functions that allow the building of GUIs, graphical data bases<BR>
  and much more. It comes with extra icons, fonts, and high level<BR>

  functions that allow the user to select colours, set cursor settings<BR>

  and and so forth. It also contains list boxes, message boxes, scroll<BR>

  bars, progress bars and more.<BR>

<P> It also contains a SCREEN PAINTER / CODE GENERATOR used to build<BR>

  menus, drop down windows, buttons and all the other tools to form a<BR>

  complete application.<BR>

<P> Graphics is fast becomming the norm for Clipper programs. The Rich<BR>

  Graphix Library is the largest and most complete graphics library<BR>

  available on the market today.<BR>

<P> The Library was developed because many of our own customers wanted<BR>

  programs that were more 'user friendly' and had windowing and graphics<BR>

  capability, particularly a Graphical User Interface or GUI.<BR>

<P> The Library itself is a balance between providing a good set of<BR>

  primitives to allow you to custom design your own windows, logos and<BR>

  images, and higher level functions that do complex tasks such as<BR>

  windows, list boxes, colour settings, cursor control, scroll bars and<BR>

  so forth. A full set of mouse functions is also provided. The Library<BR>

  contains over 180 high power functions to give you all the graphic<BR>

  programming power you will need.<BR>

<P> Also provided with the library is the source code to the demonstration<BR>
  database program so that you can see just how graphics programming is<BR>

  done in Clipper. Nothing helps speed programming more than having real<BR>

  live examples to guide you. The demo program uses most of the library<BR>

  and all of the most often used functions.<BR>
