<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Clipper programming issues</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 I keep getting financial arithmetic results that don't add up</A>
exactly.  From time to time my calculations are off by a fewcents but I'm sure there is nothing wrong with my code.  What'sthe deal?</H2>

<P>(Excellent reply contributed by
<A HREF="mailto:76064.1535@compuserve.com">David Husnian</A>.)
<P>
<P>Clipper and most computer languages use a binary floating
point format for their real numbers.  This causes precision
errors which commonly show up in calculations, comparisons
and when rounding.  The problem is related to trying to represent
an infinite number of decimal numbers into a fixed number (and a
small fixed number at that) of binary bits.
<P>
<P>Statistically, there aren't any numbers that can be represented
exactly, of course, from a practical standpoint some can be (but
they are all somehow related to powers of 2, like 1/2 or 3/8 or
127/128 or ...).
<P>
<P>Taking .275 out to just 16 bits yields:
<P>
<P>0100011000100111 but that is really only .274993896484375.  It
is impossible to represent .275 accurately in a binary numbering
system, even with unlimited bits, let alone the 64 bits that
Clipper uses (all of which aren't used for the decimal portion). 
<P>
<P>Most modern languages use a format defined by the IEEE.  An
IEEE-compliant double precision implementation meets the following
criteria:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1 sign bit, 52 bits for the mantissa and 11 for the exponent.</LI>
<LI>2.22 * 10 ^ -16 is the smallest number that, subtracted from 1.0,
gives something different than 1.0.</LI>
<LI>Normalized to 1023, which means that 10 ^ 0 will be kept as 1023,
with 10 ^ -1 as 1022 and 10 ^ 1 as 1024.</LI>
<LI>Smallest useable floating value is 2.23 * 10 ^ -308.</LI>
<LI>Largest useable floating value is 1.79 * 10 ^ 308.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>In the IEEE standard, rounding is considered to be finding the
closest representable number to the "exact" number.  Not an easy
task, particularly at the level of Clipper.
<P>
<P>There are only two complete solutions: use only integers (for
example, use 1234 to mean 12.34) or use a decimal numeric format
like BCD.
<P>
<P>With Visual Objects you will be able to make variable declarations
such as LOCAL i AS INT, which will have the effect of forcing only
integer values into a variable.
<P>
<P>CA-Clipper 5.3a is compiled and linked with the 8.0 release of Microsoft
C, including the standard math library component.  The rounding problems
under this library are likely to be somewhat less severe.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Why is "ABCDEF" = "ABC" turning up TRUE in my code?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
The single equal sign operator (=) is not what you expect.
If you have SET EXACT OFF (the default) then string comparisons
only check as far as the length of the right-side value.
If you want an exact match, then you should use the double-equals
operator (==) instead.  Many programmers forget about it on
purpose and just SET EXACT ON, but there are times (such as
looking up a partial key) when the "fuzzy match" is useful.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 What is "Internal Error 667" and what can I do about it?</A>
</H2>

<P>(Answer supplied by 
<A HREF="mailto:Josip.Almasi@sprint.pub.hr">Josip Almasi</A>, 10 February 1995.)
<P>The evaluation stack (containing LOCAL variables, etc.) has crashed
into a locked VM segment. Basically, the system has run out of memory
as the VM system only locks segments near the evaluation stack when the
memory is very old.
<P>
<P>From 
<A HREF="Ian@darkblak.demon.co.uk">Ian Day</A>, 3 February 1995:
<P>OK, you first have to imagine the layout of Clippers data segment
(DGROUP):
<P>

         ||||||||||||
         ||||||||||||          @ is where STATICs and ITEMs go

<P>The rest (the '|' bit) is called 'DS available'.
<P> 
As your program runs it will allocate local variables which will use up
the '%' region.  This regios has a high water mark and so Clipper
remembers the most LOCALs that have been used at any one time (because
you will most likely need that many again).
<P> 
The same thing happens with STATICs &amp; ITEMs.  All statics are stuffed into
the top region at startup.  ITEMs (using the item API) are allocated and
de-allocated by various parts of Clipper internally (as well as 3rd
parties).  This region also has a low water mark with the same behaviour.
<P> 
If you have a lot of STATICs/ITEMs and you program tries to go deep and
uses up a lot of LOCALs at the same time, the these two regions will
overrun each other, and you will then get a 667, which means either the
Eval Stack ('%' area) has overrun the MemVar table ('@' area) or vise
versa.
<P> 
So, you'd probably need to greatly reduce the number of static variables
that you're using, which would most likely cure this.
<P> 
If your program doesn't recurse too far, you can most likely increase
your DS avail. amount by reducing your CPU stack.  4-5K should be
sufficient for most things.
<P> 
If you still have problems, then you might want to try our debugger
(MrDebug for CA-Clipper) which has an in-built map of DGROUP and would
warn you before the fault happened, and you could then see what's going
on.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 What is "Internal Error 1210" and what can I do about it?</A>
</H2>

<P>(Reply supplied by 
<A HREF="mailto:75470.1052@compuserve.com">Norman Mongeau</A>.)
<P>Internal Error 1210 occurs when the database driver discovers an
index file inconsistency with which it cannot cope.  There are a
few things you can check in your code to eliminate this error:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Be sure that all indexes relating to a given .DBF file are open
whenever key values are updated.  (In other words, don't let
your index files get out of synch with the data files.)
 </LI>
<LI>Be sure that all your index key expressions resolve to the same
length regardless of the key value.  For example, you should
avoid using TRIM() on the whole key expression because it would
cause different records to have different key lengths.
 </LI>
<LI>Avoid having many duplicate keys in the same index.  One simple
way to create unique keys throughout is to add something like
<CODE>(STR(RECNO())</CODE> to the key expression.
 </LI>
<LI>Consider using a database driver other than DBFNTX.  The
conditions that cause IE 1210 do not occur in the other
drivers.
 </LI>
<LI>If you use <CODE>DBCREATEINDEX()</CODE> to create index files, make sure that
the key expression character parameter is consistent with the
key code block parameter.  It's okay if these expressions are
not exactly the same, but they must evaluate to the same
result.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 What is "Internal Error 5333" and what can I do about it?</A>
</H2>

<P>(Answer supplied by Samuel S. Shuster on 17 July 1993.)
<P>Internal Error 5333 occurs when the virtual memory management
subsystem gets overloaded and cannot find enough memory to
continue execution.  You can take a few steps to cope with
IE 5333:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You can force the virtual memory manager to do a partial
cleanup and compaction by executing
 
<PRE>
  @ 100, 100 SAY "" // This is an impossible screen location.
</PRE>

 </LI>
<LI>Consider using CA-Clipper 5.2d.  It contains bug fixes that
sometimes but not always solve IE 5333 problems.  (Editor's
note: Obviously, Shuster wrote this when 5.2d was the current
release.  The consensus now is that 5.2e is the most stable
CA-Clipper release.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 What is an "Unrecoverable Error 650: Processor Stack Fault"?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
It's a result of infinite recursion, which occurs when a function
calls itself, which calls itself, which calls itself, and so on
without stopping.  Most often this occurs when your error handler
has an error, which triggers the error handler...
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 What is "runtime error R6003"?</A>
</H2>

<P>The R6003 error occurs when you run a Clipper program on a machine              
that is 'too fast'. Part of the startup procedure in every executable           
is used to determine a value. That value is used in a timing loop. On           
very fast machines, the timing routine returns 0, causing an error in           
the program's initialization, since your software then fails with a             
divide by 0 error.                                                              
<P>                                                                                
To fix this problem, there are two possibilities.                               
<P>                                                                                
First, by the time that 5.3 was released, CA included the object that           
fixed the problem in that version. So, if you have 5.3, you need to             
link in __wait_4.obj to every executable you produce.                           
<P>                                                                                
If you use Clipper 5.0-5.2e, there is another object, available from            
The Oasis. The file is named R6003FIX.ZIP, and is in the patch area.            
There are complete instructions included for it's use, but it is                
essentially the same as the 5.3 fix, just link it in on every                   
executable you produce.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.8">5.8 What is "internal error 8002"?</A>
</H2>

<P>Clipper 5.3 linked with Exospace fails when creating indexes for large          
numbers of records and complex keys. Such a situation can result in internal
error 8002. To fix this simply use OPTEDIT:
<PRE>
optedit myapp.exe -extramin 4096
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.9">5.9 What about the other "Internal Errors"?</A>
</H2>

<P>An official listing of internal errors provided by Computer Associates
may be found in files IE52NG.ZIP or IE52TX.ZIP, depending on whether you
prefer a Norton Guide file format or a plain ASCII file.  These are on
the standard FTP sites, or in Library 1.
