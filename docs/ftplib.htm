<P> AJFONT is a library consisting of 66 different fonts for use in<BR>

  Clipper application.<BR>

<P> The use is very simple.<BR>

<P> To activate a set of font, just issue a command :<BR>

<P> AJFONT( n ) , where n is an integer from 1 to 66<BR>

<P> To reset the font to default, simply pass no paramater like :<BR>

<P> Anton van Straaten's Class Creation library has gone public.<BR>

<P> Documentation appears to be in .RTF format, although is extensioned as<BR>
  .DOC<BR>

<P> Just relink any application which uses Class(y) v2.0 with the new v2.4<BR>
  CLASSY.LIB, and you should gain immediate performance benefits.<BR>

  Recompiling is not necessary, although recompilation may result in<BR>

  marginally faster class creation.<BR>

<P> Aside from the performance improvements described below, some new<BR>

  features have been added in v2.4.  Changes, enhancements and new<BR>

  features are summarized below, followed by detailed descriptions of<BR>
  the more important changes.<BR>

<P> * The Class(y) Enhanced Object Inspector has been improved. Objects<BR>
  are now capable of "describing themselves", and the inspector can<BR>
  take advantage of this. See "Object Inspector Enhancements" below.<BR>

<P> * Two new command clauses have been introduced to support the<BR>

  improvements to the object inspector: the METHOD command now has an<BR>

  ACCESS clause, and the VAR command has an INTERNAL clause. These are<BR>

  documented below.<BR>

<P> * Smaller EXE: Programs which do not use advanced features such as<BR>

  metaclass message objects will produce a slightly smaller EXE (about<BR>

  6K) than with v2.0e.<BR>

<P> * Overlaying in real mode now requires three modules to be in the<BR>

  root: _CYCLASS, CSYXSEND, and CSYDISP.<BR>

<P> * DGROUP usage has been reduced compared to v2.0e.<BR>

<P> * Message scope checking and/or instance variable type restriction<BR>

  checking can be disabled by calling CsyEnforce( .f., .f. ), where<BR>
  the first parameter controls scope checking and the second parameter<BR>

  controls restriction checking on instance variables. Disabling such<BR>

  checks can improve performance and can be used when shipping a final<BR>

  executable. NOTE: This feature can be dangerous if used before a<BR>

  program has been fully tested and is known to be working correctly.<BR>
  The feature has been added due to customer request. We believe its<BR>

  impact on performance will be minimal. If you find otherwise, please<BR>

  let us know, since we are considering removing it from future<BR>
  versions.<BR>

<P> * v2.4 can be used with FiveWin, although inheritance from FiveWin<BR>

  classes is not currently supported. This should be supported in<BR>
  v2.5. Note that FIVEWIN.CH #includes OBJECTS.CH which defines class<BR>

  creation commands, which should not be included in Class(y) modules.<BR>

  You should either comment out or use #defines to ensure that<BR>
  OBJECTS.CH is not included when compiling a Class(y) module.<BR>

<P> * Sample source for the scalar classes is provided, in the SOURCE\SYS<BR>
  directory. Implementation of the scalar classes has changed<BR>
  slightly, so if you have defined your own scalar classes or modified<BR>

  CSYARRAY.PRG or CSYOBJEC.PRG, please see the section on Scalar<BR>
  Classes below.<BR>

<P> * Multiple Inheritance: a number of issues relating to multiple<BR>

  inheritance have been resolved.<BR>

<P> * IMPORTANT: Inclusion of a new header file, "csymulti.ch", is<BR>

  required in order to use the IN clause when redefining multiply<BR>

  inherited messages.<BR>

<P> * Spurious scope violations caused by protected messages inherited<BR>

  from a secondary parent should no longer occur.<BR>

<P> * A bug in v2.0e which resulted in spurious errors during multiply<BR>

  inherited class creation has been fixed.<BR>

<P> * Multiple inheritance from the Clipper classes TBrowse, TBColumn,<BR>

  and Error is now permitted. However, multiple inheritance from the<BR>
  Get class is not supported.<BR>

<P> * MESSAGE...IS can refer to a message in the current class, if the<BR>

  message being referred to has already been declared.<BR>

<P> * SOURCE CODE to the system classes has changed.  If you use or have<BR>
  modified any of the system classes, see "System Classes" below.<BR>

<P> * Class(y)'s system message classes are no longer linked in<BR>

  automatically. This can generate an error if you use these classes,<BR>

  even indirectly. See "System Message Classes" below.<BR>

<P> DBLFN - The Dark Black Long FileName Patch Library for Clipper 5.x<BR>

<P> What does it do?<BR>

<P> Well, put simply, it allows your DOS based Clipper executables to<BR>

  use Windows '95 long filenames. You simply link in the supplied<BR>
  library and your program will automatically support Win95 long<BR>

  filenames.<BR>

<P> Will it do it in Protected Mode?<BR>

<P> Yes. It's been tested with Blinker 4.10 in protected mode, so we'd<BR>

  like some poor^H^H^H^Hkind sole to try it with the others...<BR>

<P> How does it do it?<BR>

<P> We've basically replaced two internal (arrgh!) Clipper modules with<BR>
  our own to replace the standard file handling support.<BR>

<P> Di_Library is designed as a set of drop-in replacements for the basic<BR>
  xBase user input/output commands.  Such replacements are intended to<BR>

  allow for easy porting of existing xBase terminal-based applications<BR>
  to World Wide Web CGI applications.  In addition to close equivalents<BR>

  of xBase input/output commands, di_Library contains (or will contain)<BR>
  a collection of functions for HTML specific features, CGI control, and<BR>

  device manipulation.  The specific intended strength of di_Library is<BR>

  that it allows the use of identical functions for input/output from/to<BR>

  both the terminal and a web-browser.  Common SOURCE CODE, and even in<BR>

  many cases a common executable, can be used to interface whatever user<BR>

  input/output device is used to access common underlying business<BR>
  logic. In the future, di_Library might include access to more device<BR>

  types in addition to the screen and a web-browser.  The Norton Guide<BR>

  you are currently viewing contains the documentation for di_Library<BR>

  version 0.1 (alpha).<BR>

<P> Di_Library is written entirely in Clipper 5.3. Full SOURCE CODE<BR>

  accompanies each distribution of the library.<BR>

<P> Ferns' Graphics Library version 3.0 is a FREEWARE graphical library<BR>
  for CA-Clipper 5.2c and above (including 5.3). It  offers the same,<BR>
  and often more than it's commercial counterparts. And it's free, so<BR>
  you don't have to pay *anything*. Here are some of the features:<BR>

<P> Supports all VGA and SuperVGA modes (up to 1280x1024x65536 colors).<BR>

<P> It has a rewritten General Terminal, so all your standard output also<BR>
  works in graphic mode (SAY, GET, Tbrowse, etc). All you have to do is<BR>

  add *one* line of code.<BR>

<P> It's Light Lib compatible for the major functions. So you can easily<BR>
  move from Light Lib to FGLib. The mouse, font, setmode functions all<BR>

  work the same.<BR>

<P> It has Truecolor Emulation. No other graphical library offers you<BR>

  this! The dithering is the same as used in Windows and often better!<BR>

<P> It has all the graphical primitives: lines, points, circles,<BR>

  rectangles, ellipses, arc's, pie's, polygons, etc.<BR>

<P> It supports the mouse with a definable mouse-pointer shape! So you can<BR>
  change it to a hourglass, arrow, etc., etc.<BR>

<P> It supports bitmaps. You can read and write BMP and PCX images.<BR>

  Because of the Truecolor Emulation your images ALWAYS look good. You<BR>

  really can program device independant.<BR>

<P> It supports video ROM fonts and Windows 2.x proportional fonts. Works<BR>
  the same as LightLib!<BR>

<P> It's very fast and reasonable small.<BR>

<P> Oops, almost forgot: You can use Real Mode or Protected Mode.<BR>

<P> You can use patterns for filling. These patterns can even be partly<BR>
  transparent!<BR>

<P> You can display bitmaps using a transparent color.<BR>

<P> You can scale bitmaps *very* quickly (real-time).<BR>

<P> There is an extensive 70 page manual, which explains every function<BR>
  very thoroughly and there is a graphics programming tutorial.<BR>

<P> And there is a *lot* more...<BR>

<P> And no registration fee is required because this full version is<BR>

  *FREEWARE* !<BR>

<P> Please look at the demo and you'll see for yourself.<BR>

<P> Greetings, Clipper developer:<BR>

<P> As you may already know, due to the death of the Clipper third party<BR>
  market, Grumpfish Incorporated dissolved in February 1996.<BR>

  Consequently, the Grumpfish Library product was rendered no longer<BR>

  available for sale and was no longer commercially supported.<BR>

<P> However, thanks to the persistent efforts of Phil Barnett, I have<BR>

  decided to make the Grumpfish Library source code publicly available.<BR>

  This does NOT mean that this source code is now "freeware" or "public<BR>

  domain" (see "Copyright" below for further specifics). The primary<BR>

  reason behind this decision is to assist people who have been forced<BR>
  to revisit existing code in the interest of Year 2000 compliance.<BR>
  (See "Disclaimer" below for further specifics on this topic.)<BR>

<P> In exchange for my permitting you to freely make use of this source<BR>
  code, I have four small requests:<BR>

<P> 1) Please consider making a donation to help find a cure for<BR>

  Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (also commonly known as "ALS" or "Lou<BR>

  Gehrig's Disease"). Donations may be made via cheque or credit card<BR>
  to the following address and web site:<BR>

<P> The ALS Association<BR>
  27001 Agoura Road, Suite 150<BR>
  Calabasas Hills, CA 91301-5104 USA<BR>
  E-mail: alsinfo@alsa-national.org<BR>
  Phone:  818-880-9007<BR>
  Web: http://www.alsa.org/<BR>

<P> If you do make a donation, please indicate that it is being made in<BR>
  the memory of Marie Andree Summers.<BR>

<P> 2) Please drop Phil Barnett a line (at <philb@iag.net>) thanking him<BR>
  for his time and efforts in maintaining his web site.<BR>

<P> 3) If your current or future development efforts include Borland's<BR>

  Delphi product, please consider the use of my components and<BR>

  courseware.  All such information can be found at the following web<BR>

  address:<BR>

<P> http://www.greglief.com/delphi.shtml<BR>

<P> 4) Last but not least, please read ALL of the following verbiage.<BR>

  Yes, some portions may be familiar to you from other software<BR>
  license agreements, but there are certain items (particularly with<BR>

  respect to distribution and support) with which I want you to be<BR>

  absolutely clear.<BR>

<P> There have been some complaints that FT_IAmIdle() failed to release<BR>
  the CPU timeslice under certain conditions.  The problem occurred ONLY<BR>

  in protected mode applications, and ONLY under some operating systems<BR>

  (Windows NT was specifically mentioned, but others may be affected as<BR>

  well -- however, the problem does NOT appear to occur under Windows<BR>

  3.1x, Windows 95, or OS/2).<BR>

<P> In addition, there have been less serious complaints that FT_IAmIdle()<BR>
  did indeed release the timeslice, but was only marginally successful<BR>
  in doing so (e.g. during idle states, CPU usage dropped from 100%, but<BR>

  still remained high -- in some cases 60% or 70% which still had a<BR>

  negative effect on any other tasks that might be running<BR>
  concurrently).<BR>

<P> This patch addresses both of these problems by adding two OPTIONAL<BR>

  arguments to FT_IAmIdle().  The new syntax is:<BR>

<P> FT_IAmIdle( [ <nIntensity> ], [ <lForceReal> ] )<BR>

<P><nIntensity> is an optional numeric value that varies the intensity of<BR>
  the timeslice release.  The default is 1, and should be fine for most<BR>

  operating systems.  You can experiment with higher values to determine<BR>

  if you get better timeslicing (limited experimentation with Windows NT<BR>

  showed that values between 10 and 30 seemed to work pretty well).<BR>

<P><lForceReal> is an optional logical argument.  If a value of .T. is<BR>

  passed, FT_IAmIdle() will force the CPU to switch to real mode before<BR>

  releasing the time slice (this had a DRAMATIC effect under Windows<BR>
  NT). The default is .F., which causes FT_IAmIdle() to remain in the<BR>

  current CPU mode when releasing the time slice.  In a real mode<BR>

  application this argument is ignored.<BR>

<P> Remember that both of these arguments are optional, and the default<BR>
  values were chosen so that the function would retain its previous<BR>

  behavior if the arguments aren't passed.  If you are not experiencing<BR>

  any problems with FT_IAmIdle(), just continue calling it as you do<BR>

  currently, and you can remain blissfully unaware of this patch.<BR>

<P> OoClip is an extension to Clipper 5.XX to allow user defined objects<BR>
  and classes.<BR>

<P> Clipper 5.XX is probably one of the most significant advances in<BR>

  X-Base programming since the invention of the .DBF file.  One of the<BR>

  least documented and most understood new features is that of objects.<BR>

  Perhaps the reason for this is that unlike the rest of the language,<BR>

  Clipper classes and objects are inflexible - you can't change them,<BR>
  and you can't create your own.  Without these abilities, it is not<BR>

  truly an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, and yields none<BR>
  of the benefits of OOP such as polymorphism, reusability, or<BR>

  inheritance.<BR>

<P> OoClip fills in this small but glaring hole in the OOP ability of<BR>

  Clipper 5.XX by providing the ability to create your own classes and<BR>

  objects.  You can work with these objects just as you can the ones<BR>

  provided by Nantucket, with the added benefit of inheritance.  Objects<BR>

  created with OoClip return VALTYPE() of "O", and are recognized<BR>

  internally as objects to Clipper itself.<BR>

<P> PD_OOP  The PUBLIC DOMAIN Object Oriented Library.<BR>

<P> This library of basic object classes and functions for CLIPPER 5.x was<BR>
  concieved and designed with several purposes in mind.<BR>

<P> 1. To show that there is no huge learning curve to creating an object<BR>
  class for general use, contrary to my opinion when I first started it.<BR>

<P> 2. To create a core set of objects that had no bloat, ran as fast as<BR>
  possible in the smallest, tightest set of code. No small task, and one<BR>

  that never ends.<BR>

<P> 3. That it is possible for OOP and procedure code to exist<BR>

  side-by-side on your desk as complimentary tools, not as either-or.<BR>

<P> 4. To give examples of how a class might be used, and hopefully<BR>

  suggest additional uses.<BR>

<P> 5. To give even experienced OOP users a chance to look at another<BR>

  theory of OOP construction, and maybe another side of the coin.<BR>

<P> 6. To give something back for all of the thousands of lines of code<BR>
  I've downloaded, analyzed, and made part of my own set of tools over<BR>

  the years.<BR>

<P> 7. And maybe let someone else take a quick peek at all of this, get<BR>
  that flash of smile and think "Boy, can I use this!"<BR>

<P> C is generally considered to be a "bare-bones" language. A way to put<BR>
  some flesh on those bones is to develop generalized functions<BR>

  (extensions) which  may be reused in many programs. The presence of<BR>

  these functions can make programming a quick and simple task. The<BR>

  absence of these language extensions can mean many hours lost<BR>

  "re-inventing the wheel".<BR>

<P> Few programmers have the time required to develop and debug such a<BR>

  library of functions. This is where the SoftC Database Library comes<BR>

  in. This library is a collection of functions designed to make your<BR>

  applications quicker and easier to code and test. With the library you<BR>

  can spend time on your application not on developing tools.<BR>

<P> There also is a benefit to using functions found in a toolkit library<BR>
  versus using the functions found in your compiler's library. It may<BR>

  seem trivial, but if you ever decide to change compilers you will find<BR>

  that it will take many hours to convert your source to match the new<BR>

  compiler's syntax. Using a generic toolkit such as SoftC will<BR>
  eliminate that effort.<BR>

<P> SoftC adds powerful capabilities to your function library:<BR>

<P> -database data and index file functions<BR>
  -date and time manipulation and calculation<BR>

<P> The SoftC Database Library is intended for use as a supplement to your<BR>
  compiler's object libraries. It contains forty-nine functions. Its<BR>

  focus is dBaseIII compatible data and index file manipulation<BR>

  functions. The clock/calendar functions have been added to enhance the<BR>

  core dBase routines. The library is currently available for Turbo C<BR>
  2.0 and Microsoft C 5.1. These routines were written entirely in C.<BR>

<P> The final version of SuperLib, and now it's FREEWARE, and it comes<BR>

  with 100% SOURCE CODE and extensive norton guide.<BR>

<P> SuperLib is a library of functions for Clipper 5.x.<BR>

<P> What makes SuperLib different than other libraries on the marketplace<BR>
  is that is contains a large collection of METAFUNCTIONS. A<BR>
  metafunction is like a pre-packaged mini application, ready to link<BR>
  and run. For instance, SuperLib's report writer is as simple to use<BR>
  as:<BR>

<P> USE <dbfname><BR>
  REPORTER()<BR>

<P> All of the metafunctions are menu-driven and ready to use without<BR>

  modifications. All SuperLib functions are data independant. All that<BR>
  is required is an open DBF file. SuperLib will determine the field<BR>

  structure and use the current DBF. SuperLib requires no special setup<BR>

  or way of doing things. It works with you, not against you. SuperLib<BR>

  functions will do their best to save/restore all settings as they<BR>
  found them. (such as colors, cursor, screens, etc.)<BR>

<P> There are over 300 functions in SuperLib, ranging from the<BR>

  metafunctions down to the granular common component functions such as<BR>

  events and popups. (see the function list below, or the .NG file)<BR>

<P> This version of SuperLib is 100% mouse aware! All SuperLib functions<BR>
  are automatically aware of the mouse and respond to the mouse.<BR>
  SuperLib even contains replacements for Clipper's READ, MENU TO,<BR>

  ACHOICE and MEMOEDIT functions that are mouse aware. Several functions<BR>

  are provided to help you build mouse awareness into your own<BR>
  functions.<BR>

<P> SuperLib is Blinker 3.x, 4.x and Exospace compatible for protected<BR>

  mode programs. SuperLib is 99.9 % pure Clipper code, and uses no<BR>

  Clipper internals, which makes for painless upgrading to future<BR>

  versions of Clipper and the various linkers.<BR>

<P> SuperLib is network ready, with all locking already built in. (works<BR>
  fine for single-user too)<BR>

<P> There is no registration of SuperLib, since it is now freeware. The<BR>
  author, Gary Prefontaine, is no longer supporting the product. If you<BR>

  need help with this library, please ask on comp.lang.clipper<BR>

<P> Thanks, Gary.<BR>

<P> WP Create (tm) 2.1 for Clipper Feature List. FREEWARE!<BR>

<P> High-Powered Report Writing, Database Publishing, and Document<BR>

  Databases Made Easy<BR>

<P> WP Create for Clipper is a library and code generator that enables<BR>

  Clipper 5 programs to read and write WordPerfect-format files.  The<BR>

  package permits Clipper developers to incorporate high-end report<BR>

  writing and database publishing capabilities into their Clipper 5<BR>

  applications with a minimum of effort.<BR>

<P> WP Create was formerly a commercially-sold package; it is still<BR>

  copyrighted, but is now free and may be redistributed freely. It is<BR>

  provided "AS IS" and without warranties.<BR>

<P> With simple WP Create function calls, a Clipper application can read<BR>
  files from WordPerfect 5.x or 6.0 for DOS or Windows.  Going in the<BR>

  other direction, the WordPerfect 5.1 files generated by a Clipper<BR>

  application using WP Create are ready to be edited, printed, or<BR>

  inserted into another document with WordPerfect 5.1 or 6.0 for DOS or<BR>

  Windows.<BR>

<P> The XSETMODE Library enhances the CA-Clipper SetMode() function by<BR>

  allowing the following Text Mode resolutions to be set from within<BR>
  your CA-Clipper application:<BR>

<P> Col x Row        Comments<BR>

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
  40 x 12         Little room for text, but might come in handy to display<BR>
  information that is to be seen, or for visually disabled.<BR>
  40 x 25 Standard BIOS mode<BR>
  40 x 28         A little variation on the standard BIOS mode<BR>
  40 x 50 No too much columns, but lot's o' rows..<BR>
  80 x 12         Lot's o' columns, not too much rows..<BR>
  Also mode that might be used in some circumstances where<BR>
  one would want large characters on screen.<BR>
  80 x 25         The mother of all text modes<BR>
  80 x 28         A nice variation, 3 extra lines and still very readable.<BR>
  My personal favorite.<BR>
  80 x 43         Well known mode of 43 lines.<BR>
  80 x 50         Also well known mode.<BR>
  80 x 60         Requires VESA compliant card that supports this mode<BR>

  132 x 25        Idem<BR>
  132 x 43        Idem<BR>
  132 x 50        Idem<BR>
  132 x 60        Idem<BR>

<P> P.S. I have feedback that this routine trashes W95 in a 'have to<BR>

  reboot to reclaim my computer' manner. Then, had to replace the video<BR>

  driver as it became totally confused. It's probably not a good idea to<BR>

  incorporate this function into anything but DOS executables.<BR>
