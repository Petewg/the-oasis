<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 What are LOCAL variables and why do I care?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
LOCAL variables are somewhat like PRIVATE variables in that they
do not "scope up"; if you declare a PRIVATE or LOCAL variable in
function B which is called from function A, then function A does
not know the variable exists.  Function A is even free to use the
same name for a different variable entirely without risk of
confusion.  This is useful for writing functions that can avoid
"stepping on" the variables that are floating around a larger
application.
<P>LOCAL variables, introduced with Clipper 5.0, enforce a stricter
kind of modularity.  A LOCAL variable must be declared, and it
is visible only to the particular function in which it is
declared.  (Remember that PRIVATEs are created by default.)  Not
only does a LOCAL variable refrain from "up-scoping" but it also
will not "down-scope" either.
<P>For example:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
// LOCAL1.PRG
FUNCTION caller
LOCAL a
PRIVATE x, y
a := "a"
x := "ABC"
y := "123"
? a, x, y        // Prints "a       ABC     123"
callee()
? a, x, y        // Prints "a       ABC     456"
RETURN NIL
 
FUNCTION callee
LOCAL a
PRIVATE x        // Notice y not declared PRIVATE!
x := "DEF"
y := "456"
? a, x, y        // Prints "NIL     DEF     456"
RETURN NIL
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The values of (a) in the two functions are completely
independent of each other, because they are indeed two
separate variables.  The values of (x) in the two functions
are also separate and independent, because CALLEE() has declared
its version of (x) PRIVATE.  There is only one (y) variable,
however, since CALLEE() has neglected to declare it.
<P>LOCAL variables are useful for writing code that is guaranteed
bulletproof regardless of the application environment.  LOCAL
variables (and their cousins, the STATICs) are immune from having
their values changed by unrelated underlying functions.  This cuts
down on maintenance and debugging while offering some speed
advantages too.
<P>Because all uses of a local variable are known to the compiler
(being all in one function) there is no need for an entry in the
run-time symbol table, which does save some time and memory during
program execution.  A side effect is that the names of LOCAL
variables in a macro expression are not found; therefore
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
LOCAL x, y
x := "y"
? &amp;x
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>will fail unless there is a PRIVATE or PUBLIC variable named (y).
<P>LOCALs work just like "auto" or stack variables in C and C++.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 What are STATIC variables and why do I care?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
STATIC variables are similar to LOCALs in that they do not
"up-scope" or "down-scope."  STATICs, however, keep their value
throughout the duration of the program, even when they are not
"visible."  For example:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
// STATIC1.PRG
FUNCTION caller
LOCAL i
? "BEGIN"
FOR i := 1 TO 100
        ? "Loop number ", i
        callee()
NEXT
? "END"
RETURN NIL
 
FUNCTION callee
LOCAL l := 0
STATIC s := 0
l++
s++
? l, s
RETURN NIL
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The output will look like this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
    BEGIN
    Loop number     1
        1      1
    Loop number     2
        1      2
    Loop number     3
        1      3
    Loop number     4
        1      4
        ...    ...
    Loop number   100
        1    100
    END
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Notice that each iteration of the loop increments the value of (s)
from the previous iteration, while the value of (l) starts all over
again from scratch.
<P>The most common use of STATIC variables is to maintain values that
are useful to a group of functions, or to the whole application,
without resorting to global PRIVATE or PUBLIC variables.  (See next
Question.)
<P>STATIC variables carry the same features as LOCALs with regard to
symbol table entries and macro expansion as noted above.
<P>STATICs work just like static variables in C and C++.
<P>Someone (whose identity I've unfortunately misplaced) wrote to add: "It
is dangerous to use large numbers of STATIC variables in an application,
since they must all fit into one 64K data segment.  The FAQ proposes
creating an array of values rather than a plethora of STATICs, but I
wonder if this problem should be mentioned more prominently."  So there
it is.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 How do I switch all my PUBLICs to STATICs?</A>
</H2>

<P>Pull these variables in logical groups (e.g., all colors in
one place) into separate source files and declare them STATIC.
Then write a function or set of functions which allow you to get
(and optionally set) the values of these variables.  For example,
COLORS1.PRG will return the current value of the cNormal variable,
and will also set the variable if you pass it a value.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
// COLORS1.PRG
STATIC cNormal
FUNCTION setnorm (x)
LOCAL cRet := cNormal
IF x != NIL
 cNormal := x
ENDIF
RETURN cRet
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>If you have more than a few of these variables to get and set this
may present a problem; the source and object code for these functions
will quickly grow out of hand!  So let's take it one step further by
hiding this batch of functions with the preprocessor.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
// COLORS2.PRG--Link this into your application.
// Colors: 1 Normal  2 Error Message  3 Prompt  4 F-key legend
STATIC acColor[4]
FUNCTION setstdcol (x, y)
LOCAL cRet := acColor[x]
IF y != NIL
 acColor[x] := y
ENDIF
RETURN cRet
 
// APP.CH-- #include this in all your application's source files.
#xtranslate setnorm   (&lt;x>) => setstdcol (1, &lt;x>)
#xtranslate seterr    (&lt;x>) => setstdcol (2, &lt;x>)
#xtranslate setprompt (&lt;x>) => setstdcol (3, &lt;x>)
#xtranslate setfkey   (&lt;x>) => setstdcol (4, &lt;x>)
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>With this set of directives and the single function setstdcol()
you can keep the size of your sources and EXE down.  At the same
time the application programmer (you or someone else) can have a
stable interface to this array of values no matter how large the
application gets or how many new elements you want to add to the
array.
<P>There is a school of thought that believes that variables that are
truly global in intent should just be made PUBLIC anyway.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 What are the ground rules for using LOCALs and STATICs?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
LOCALs and STATICs must be the first statements in a function,
except possibly for the PARAMETERS statement.  They may be
declared with initial values (e.g. LOCAL a := 1), but STATICs may
not be initialized with a value that is unknown to the compiler
(e.g. STATIC b := myfunc()--where myfunc is the name of your
user-defined function--is invalid).  The initialization is
performed every time the function is called (in the case of
LOCALs) or once at the beginning of the program (in the case of
STATICs).
<P>If you want to use a file-wide STATIC variable to share information
among functions within the same source module, that module must be
compiled with the /n switch, and the STATIC declarations must
precede the first FUNCTION or PROCEDURE.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 What are INIT and EXIT procedures?  Why do I care?</A>
</H2>

<P>A procedure declared as INIT PROCEDURE &lt;name> will always execute
on program startup before the main procedure is executed.  A
procedure declared as EXIT PROCEDURE &lt;name> will likewise execute
just after the main procedure terminates.
<P>INIT PROCEDUREs are useful if you have STATIC variable
initializations that cannot be done inline.  Both INIT and EXIT
PROCEDUREs are handy for generalized setup and cleanup
in a module that you want to make fully independent of the
calling program.
<P>INIT FUNCTION works the same as INIT PROCEDURE, and EXIT
FUNCTION works the same as EXIT PROCEDURE.  Their return values
are ignored though.
<P>Clipper makes no guarantees as to the order of execution of INIT and
EXIT procedures.
<P>On this point, Clayton Neff writes:
If you have 3 or 4 INIT functions, you don't have any
control over the order in which they are called.  Since the RDD setup
routines are also in an INIT function, Clipper won't necessarily have
set up the RDD system before your INIT function is called.  This would
cause any data file access routines to crash.  The same is true for EXIT
routines as well.
<P>The INIT and EXIT features worked fine in
Clipper 5.01 but weren't documented until the 5.2 release.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 What are the ANNOUNCE and REQUEST statements?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
(Answer supplied by Doug Lee.)
<P>REQUEST is used to force functions, procedures, and modules to be
linked into an application whether or not they are referenced
directly.  REQUEST officially replaces the EXTERNAL statement
provided in versions of Ca-Clipper prior to 5.2.
<P>Functions and procedures are linked into an application
automatically if they are referenced directly in the source code
or if they are located in .OBJ files which are explicitly listed
in the link script.  However, if a function is not referenced
until run time and is to be drawn from a library, it must be
REQUESTed.  Examples of this include INIT and EXIT procedures,
functions and procedures referenced only from within index
expressions or report forms, and MEMOEDIT user functions.  If you
have a report form which calls MEMOTRAN and your application makes
no further reference to that function, you must include the line
<P>REQUEST MEMOTRAN
<P>in one of your source files.
<P>ANNOUNCE is used to name modules for REQUESTing.  By using
ANNOUNCE, you can cause a whole collection of procedures and
functions to be linked into an application with one REQUEST line.
If you have a module containing a number of functions used
exclusively by report forms, you may place a statement like
<P>ANNOUNCE REPUTILS
<P>at the top of the module.  You may then REQUEST REPUTILS to bring
the whole module into the application.
<P>REQUEST and ANNOUNCE are often used in conjunction with INIT and
EXIT procedures to establish the environment of an application with
minimal effort.  For example, you could write a module similar to
the following and include it in your local function library:
<P>ANNOUNCE STARTUP
<P>STATIC screen
<P>INIT PROCEDURE myInit()
<P>* Preserve the screen which was active when this app was started
screen := SAVESCREEN(0,0, 24,79)
<P>* Initialize the Clipper environment
SET SCOREBOARD OFF
SET EXCLUSIVE OFF
:
:
<P>RETURN NIL
<P>EXIT PROCEDURE myExit()
<P>* Restore the screen which was active when this app was started
RESTSCREEN(0,0, 24,79, screen)
<P>RETURN NIL
<P>Then, including the line
<P>REQUEST STARTUP
<P>would automatically cause the screen to be saved and restored
across program execution, etc.

Subject: CA-Clipper Frequently Asked Questions
Date: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 15:38:33 GMT
</PRE>
<P>
<P>A REQUEST statement tells the Clipper compiler to ask the linker to
resolve an external reference.  So, instead of calling an actual function,
you can request the module that it resides in.  This is most useful for
making sure the proper RDD is linked in, since your code won't call the
data access functions directly.  An ANNOUNCE statement simply adds an
identifier to the object code.  This way you can label a particular module
internally in such a way that the linker will find it, even if there is no
actual function with that name.  Again, this is useful with RDDs, since it
is unlikely that there would be a function or procedure called DBFCDX.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7 Is it more efficient to use one multi-dimensional array or</A>
several single dimension arrays in a program? The array(s)would be static and called at the top of the program.</H2>

<P>(Answer supplied by Mark Neidorff.)
<P>Assembler programmers are very familiar with memory segments.  Each
segment is a 64k block of memory.  Clipper uses the DS segment as a
lookup table for several different types of information.  In Clipper
the DS segment is called DGROUP.  Third-party libraries may be
significant users of DGROUP.  Once DGROUP is filled, a program crashes.
This is normally not a concern for developers.
<P>An entry in DGROUP is created for each static variable in a program.
By minimizing DGROUP usage, a program is made more bullet-proof.
Therefore, from the standpoint of DGROUP usage, a single static
multi-dimensional array is more efficient than several single
dimensional arrays.
<P>From a completely different perspective, a multi-dimensional array is a
model of data.  Once you are comfortable with multi-dimensional
arrays, you can dynamically store data in your code.  A 50 record 3
field lookup table (dbf file) can be represented in memory with an
array like this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
    // MyLookup[3,50]
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>At startup you can read the entire table into the array once and close
the table saving a file handle and cutting down on disk lookups every
time you browse or seek in the table.  (This is especially significant
on a network system)  This type of modeling is not possible with
single dimensional arrays.  You also do not have to know the size of
the array before it is created since you can dynamically resize the
array with the aadd() function.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.8">8.8 What is the meaning of the compiler warning "Ambiguous</A>
reference: GETLIST"?</H2>

<P> 
GETLIST is an array variable that is created by CA-Clipper, by
default, as the list of all currently used GET objects.  (The
@...GET command preprocesses into an AADD (Getlist, ...) call,
and READ references Getlist also.)
<P>If you don't declare GETLIST in your code the compiler won't
realize that the variable will in fact exist at runtime, hence
the warning.  If this bothers you, you can put the statement
MEMVAR GETLIST in a header file that is shared throughout the
application, or even declare GETLIST as a LOCAL in functions that
use GETs and READs if your program organization allows it.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.9">8.9 I am getting lockups running my CA-Clipper application under</A>
DOS 6.0.  It worked under DOS 5.0.  What's going on?</H2>

<P> 
If you are running Clipper 5.01 apps <EM>and</EM> DOS 6.0 <EM>and</EM> are
running EMM386.EXE <EM>and</EM> using its NOEMS command-line parameter,
<EM>then</EM> you should also use the NOVCPI parameter with EMM386
<EM>or</EM> include E0 in your CLIPPER environment variable.
<P>
<P> 
This is due to a check that the Clipper 5.01 runtime performed
to verify the existence of EMS that is not fully compatbile with
the EMM386.EXE that comes with DOS 6.0.
<P>
<P>Another option, if you really need EMS memory, is to link in the object
provided in EMM501.ZIP from The Oasis. This will allow S'87 and 5.01 to
correctly detect EMM memory.
<P>
<P> 
If you move to CA-Clipper 5.2e or 5.3b this problem goes away.

<A HREF="mailto:mzurier@cris.com">Mark Zurier</A><P>
<P>Yes, if you follow these guidelines:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use large model only (the <CODE>-ml</CODE> command-line compiler switch).</LI>
<LI>Use no floating point operations, and disable them with
the <CODE>-f-</CODE> switch.</LI>
<LI>Use no Borland library functions; you may use standard C
functions if they are found in CLIPPER.LIB or LLIBCE.LIB.</LI>
<LI>You may leave register variables on and/or optimize
for registers/jumps/speed.</LI>
<LI>You may use the <CODE>-v</CODE> switch to include debugging information
in your object code for Turbo Debugger.</LI>
<LI>Turn stack checking off.</LI>
<LI>If you use inline assembly, push DS before doing anything
and pop it when done, unless you are SURE your code doesn't
do anything to affect DS.</LI>
</UL>
<P>One workable set of switches seems to be <CODE>-c -f- -ml -N-</CODE>.
For optimized C code, try <CODE>-c -f- -ml -N- -Z -O -G -w</CODE>.
<P>Zurier wrote later:
Well, it's a little old and really only applies to Clipper Summer '87
and 5.0 with BC++ 16-bit versions.  It's up to you, but if you include
it, please put that caveat in there.  I neither use Clipper nor Borland
anymore; I'm all Visual C++ and Java (Visual J++ for now due to the
tight integration) and thank God the 32-bit world finally got rid of the
stupid memory models &lt;g>.
<P>In fact, based on that, it seems the article is way out of date.  I'd
only use it if you think there are still 16-bit people out there.  I
don't.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.11">8.11 Is there a way to recompile or relink the standard CA-Clipper</A>
libraries to make CA-Clipper fully compatible with the Borlandcompilers?</H2>

<P>No.  Floating point function calls are too tightly coupled with
the compiler's code generation to allow that to be done.
<P>It is possible to write BCD replacement functions for the very
low-level functions that call the floating-point math
libraries.  (They have names such as __DVADD() and can be found
in the map file output from any decent linker.)  The problem
with this approach is that any numeric _literals_ in the source
code are already embedded into the object code as double-precision
floats.  There does not appear to be a good way for a replacement
math library to deal with the fact that sometimes it will be
handed BCD numerics and float numerics at different times.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.12">8.12 How about C++?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Last updated 17 June 1991: contributions by Diane Lask
<P> 
Any C++ function which interfaces to your CA-Clipper code must be
declared consistently as <CODE>extern "C" CLIPPER func (void)</CODE>
<P>
<P> 
This is an ANSI linkage specifier which turns off "name mangling."
One disadvantage is that if a function name is overloaded of course
you may only access one instance of that function name from your
CA-Clipper code.  (Otherwise how could CA-Clipper tell them apart?)
<P>
<P> 
If your C++ code must call Extend API functions, then you should
edit your copy of EXTEND.H or EXTEND.API to bracket all the
function declarations with the following code:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
 
  /* Existing function declarations here. */
 
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P> 
C++ code which is not called directly from your CA-Clipper
application can be safely left "mangled."  For Borland C++ users,
the normal prohibitions on use of floating point math remain.

<P>For those who do not read German fluently or who do not have
regular access to Compuserve it might be easier to purchase
the C 5.1 library from Microsoft as a "downgrade" from a

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.15">8.15 Can you use Borland's Turbo Debugger with the embedded C and assembler</A>

<P>Yes.  For best results, compile the C code with the -v switch,
assemble with /zi, and Turbo-link with /v.  Then just fire up
TD with the name of your executable and set a breakpoint at
the beginning of your C or assembler function of interest.
<P>I have found that TD286, Borland's 80286 protected-mode debugger,
works as well without crowding CA-Clipper code out of memory.
Still you are probably better off testing your C/assembler code
from a small "shell" CA-Clipper program to save run-time memory.
<P>It is difficult to use TD386 with a CA-Clipper program since the
former cannot coexist with the EMM386 expanded memory driver,
and the later runs better with expanded memory.

Contributions by 
<A HREF="mailto:73067.3332@compuserve.com">Ted Means</A><P>Clipper 5.0 performed under-the-hood memory optimizations that
sometimes resulted in two strings being assigned the same pointer.
<P>For example, if you did this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
       X := "Some string"
       Y := X
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>In all likelihood Clipper would simply make a copy of the pointer
rather than actually copying the string.  It sounds great in
theory, because it saves memory.  But problems arose when a C or
ASM routine attempted to modify X or Y by writing directly to the
assigned memory.  Since the same pointer was assigned to two
different memvars, they both got changed, even though that was
not the intended effect.
<P>So with the release of Clipper 5.01, Nantucket graciously
provided a method for accessing strings that is more convenient. 
If you call __StorCLen with a null pointer *before* calling
__ParC, it warns Clipper that you plan to directly modify a
__ParC pointer and Clipper will take whatever steps are necessary
to make it safe to do so.
<P>This gives the best of both worlds, in that Clipper can still
perform its memory optimizations, but C and ASM programmers get
the benefit of being able to directly modify strings.  This is
all documented in the Release Notes, but briefly, if you need to
write directly to a string, use the following sequence:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Call __ParCLen to get the string's length.</LI>
<LI>Call __StorCLen with the length and a null pointer.</LI>
<LI>Call __ParC to get a pointer to the string.  This
pointer will be safe to write to.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Writing directly to a __ParC pointer without using this method is
not sanctioned by Nantucket and is likely to cause problems. 
Note, though, that if you don't need to write to the string you
can simply call __ParC by itself.
