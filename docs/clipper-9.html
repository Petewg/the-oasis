<P>(Disclaimer: I'm not only a fan of FlagShip but a developer of
FlagShip add-ons and a reseller of WGS's Linux package.  But they
honestly do have a great product.)

<P>FlagShip claims to be "NOT a porting tool" but "in fact a full Unix
implemetation of CA-Clipper through version 5.2e."  A spokesman goes
on to say that "the fact that C intermediate code exists is useful for
some, but safe to ignore for most users."
<P>
<P>There is also a freeware portable translator for Clipper called

to be a commercial product but the publisher decided to redirect
its resources to other projects.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 I want to read and write files on my IBM minicomputer(s): a</A>
 System/38 or AS/400.  How can I accomplish this?</H2>

<P>
<P>Last updated 1 January 1994; contributions by Brad H. Codd of Aladdin.
<P>A product from Aladdin allows your CA-Clipper application to access
native AS400 data files at the record level.  Call Aladdin at
+27 11 642-4588.  Technical support was
promised to be available in Los Angeles, California USA beginning
January 1992, but I have not verified this.
<P>As of July 1993 I have been informed that this can also be done
with CAS400 by T.L. Creates at +1 209 946 0105, and with Clip2
by Dabiwa, Ltd., at +1 215 692 8130.
<P>An RDD called Win/400 does the same.  I don't have contact
info for this product though.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 What's the big deal about this FoxPro Rushmore Technology?</A>
A long time ago when I was still developing in DOS I was thinking aboutswitching from CA-Clipper to FoxPro!</H2>

<P>Rushmore is not an index type, nor is it magic as the Fox people
would have you believe.  It is simply a FoxPro feature that
automatically figures out the most efficient way to use existing
indexes in a query (LOCATE, LIST, anything with a FOR clause,
etc.).
<P>Rushmore is handy for interactive queries, but most application
developers can know ahead of time what lookups need to be done
on their database files and can arrange for an optimized lookup
the old-fashioned way with little effort.
<P>That's why the Rushmore test results look so good but are not very
relevant to what many application developers really do.  If you
are trying to write a very open-ended reporting program, on the
other hand, it may be just the ticket.
<P>Third-party database drivers (RDDs) for Clipper can perform
similar query optimization.  Two that I know of are Mach Six
(included in The SIx Driver package) and ClipMore (an add-in
to COMIX).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5 Someone said I could access FoxPro-type indices.  What</A>
is the difference between FoxPro indices and CA-Clipper indices?What gain can I get from doing that, and how?</H2>

<P>First off, there are several advantages to using a FoxPro-like
index scheme.
<P>*.CDX files can contain more than one "tag," each of which relates
to an index key.  Therefore you can drop all your many CA-Clipper
*.NTX files by converting each to a "tag" within a single .CDX file.
This also lets you always open a file with <CODE>USE &lt;file>
INDEX &lt;file></CODE>
with assurance that you got all the tags.  Better still, when
you perform a plain
<CODE>USE &lt;file></CODE>,
the driver will automatically
find and open a corresponding .CDX file with the same base name
as the datafile.
<P>Replaceable Database Drivers which support FoxPro-like files are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The SIx Driver by Successware</LI>
<LI>Comix by Loadstone</LI>
<LI>The DBFCDX driver already included in CA-Clipper 5.2e</LI>
<LI>The DBFCDX driver in CA-Clipper 5.3 *is* Comix.</LI>
</UL>
<P>SIx itself does not give you Rushmore lookups, but it is shipped
with an add-in called MACH which does.  Likewise Comix has an
accompanying library called ClipMore which does the same thing.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.6">9.6 How do I dial a modem from within a CA-Clipper application?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
The modem on a serial port can be looked at as just another file
as far as output is concerned.  (This is a useful
oversimplification.)  You just need to open the serial port as a
file and write a string such as "ATDT123-4567" followed by a carriage
return and line feed to send a Hayes-compatible dial command to the
modem.  A function like this would do the job nicely:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
FUNCTION dialphone (nPort, cNumber)
LOCAL nFile := FCREATE ("COM" + STR (nPort, 1))  // Open port
FWRITE (nFile, "ATDT"+cNumber+CHR(13)+CHR(10))   // Write ATDT command
FCLOSE (nFile)                                   // Close it
RETURN NIL
